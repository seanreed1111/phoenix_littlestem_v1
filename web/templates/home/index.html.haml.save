                  We are a team that makes beautiful picture
                  books showing young girls engaged with science
                  and technology-related themes.

                %p
                  We want children to see themselves in the images of the
                  books they read.
                %p Donations by supporters and purchases of our books help us fund free picture books for libraries, schools, and after-school organizations.
                %p
                  Together, we can help encourage girls to see careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) as goals and options from a young age.
                %h3
                  %span.color OUR PHILOSOPHY
                %p We believe books help show children who they can become.
                %p
                  We want the little ones who enjoy our books
                  to self-identify as kids who like science and
                  math, so they'll keep STEM-related careers in
                  their minds in the future.
                %p
                  We believe this is one way to
                  help young girls and boys see
                  that STEM is for everyone.

              %em Serena Sees Her Footprints on the Moon
            is about a young girl who imagines a fun trip to the Moon, where she plays with some of the objects left
            behind up there by the Apollo astronauts.

          %h3 We read the book as family and we loved it. The callbacks to Serena seeing her footprints on the moon made a real impression on my 3 (almost 4) year old daughter.
          %p
          %h3 The next morning she said 'Daddy, did you know there are footprints on the moon?'' Good work!" - Robert M.

          %h3 Happy to report that I learned some extra things about the moon program by reading Serena sees her foot prints! I hope this is a format you plan to repeat for other books in the STEM space. - Gavin H.

          %h3 Such a lovely book.  Pure poetry.  The narration is at once elegiac and triumphant.  I love the confidence Serena exudes; she is a wonderful protagonist (a clear role model for women, girls, and POC).
          %p
          %h3 I especially liked her assurance that though humans haven’t been on the far side of the Moon, she has been there.
          %p
          %h3 I’m confident that readers will be spurred to do more research into the history of the Moon landings (and plans for return) after reading “Serena”! Best wishes with the launch! - Christine R.

          %h3 I absolutely love the repetition. I think it can really be a story whose words echo in children’s minds as they grow up. I also like the motif of the permanence of the little girl’s accomplishments.
          %p
          %h3 Even if nobody else can acknowledge Serena’s accomplishments, she sees the evidence of them herself and can rest assured that they cannot be taken from her. - Emma. G.

          %h3 I think this would make a great story for younger girls. I like how it not only inspires girls to reach for the things they didn’t know possible, but also tells them a lot bit about what the moon is like.
          %p
          %h3 This is definitely a great way to get get girls interested in STEM fields from a young age. And I like the cover art :) - Alli. B.

          %h3 This story is really cool! I can see Serena's excitement about her footprints on the especially through your use of repetition. The simplicity of the facts translates well and paints very vivid pictures. I didn't have to think very hard to see her on the moon and exploring and making these discoveries. Short and sweet and too the point, I can definitely see this being part of circle time in Pre-K and Kindergarten classrooms. - Keith M.
